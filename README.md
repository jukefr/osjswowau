## 📝 Configuration
The default settings should work out of the box for most people.

When encountering a timeout error, a second or third attempt at launching osjswowau should work.

If not, you might need to adjust some configuration values.

`__utils.js.schema` contains useful comments to explain the variables.

### ⚡️ CurseForge addons - https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons

```

### ⚡️ WoWInterface addons - https://www.wowinterface.com/

On linux just run it in the same wine container with the same prefix and everything should work just fine.

## 🚑 Debug
The debug mode can help you learn the location of the configuration file.

It also display more information about errors which may be useful for reporting issues.

To enable the debug mode either set `config.debug` to `true`.

Or run the command with the `DEBUG` environment variable : `DEBUG=1 osjswoway`
